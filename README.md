# Convolution-Discrete-time-signal-
Code to find Convolution of given two discrete time signal.Convolution, one of the most important concepts in electrical engineering, can be used to determine the output a system produces for a given input signal. It can be shown that a linear time invariant system is completely characterized by its impulse response. The sifting property of the discrete time impulse function tells us that the input signal to a system can be represented as a sum of scaled and shifted unit impulses. Thus, by linearity, it would seem reasonable to compute of the output signal as the sum of scaled and shifted unit impulse responses. That is exactly what the operation of convolution accomplishes. Hence, convolution can be used to determine a linear time invariant system's output from knowledge of the input and the impulse response.Discrete time convolution is an operation on two discrete time signals defined by the integral  (f∗g)(n)=∑k=−∞∞f(k)g(n−k)
